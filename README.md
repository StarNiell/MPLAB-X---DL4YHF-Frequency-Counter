# PIC16F628A_AS_DL4YHF.X

## General info
This project is simple low-cost digital frequency meter using a PIC 16F628A  
originally created by Wolfgang Buescher, DL4YHF, (based on a work by James Hutchby, MadLab, 1996).
This project is an ex MPLAB 8 project (MPASM Assembly compilator), ported to MPLAB X 6 project (pic-as Assembly compilator)
by Aniello Di Nardo (IU8NQI)   

## Requirements
* A PCB board based on the PIC16F628A designed by Wolfgang Buescher, DL4YHF
* MPLAB X - pic-as compilator
* A standard (or advanced) PIC programmer board (eg: PICkit3, PICkit4, PIC K150, ...)
